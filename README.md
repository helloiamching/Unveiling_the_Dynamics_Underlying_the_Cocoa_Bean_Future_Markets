# Unveiling-the-Dynamics-Underlying-the-Cocoa-Bean-Future-Markets
#Cocoa farmers in the futures market cannot compete with formidable, international financial groups. To mitigate this economic disadvantage, this article aims to demystify the seasonal patterns in cocoa futures trading volume and provide beneficial insights for smallholders in optimizing trading strategies in the agricultural market. Using weekly data from January 2000 to December 2019, we consider both single and multiple seasonalities and analyze them using seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) methods. Traditional diagnostic approaches are employed to evaluate model performance. To address challenges posed by fitting high-lag ARIMA and SARIMA models, we propose a specific criterion for the Ljung-Box test, which emphasizes the resemblance of residuals to white noise at high lags. Model selection is based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The results indicate significant seasonal patterns, which can help smallholders formulate optimal trading strategies. This research provides a robust statistical framework for understanding market dynamics and offers practical support to smallholders and nonprofit organizations in the agricultural sector.
